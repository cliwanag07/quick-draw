Objective: 
Strike your opponent first at the right time before they strike you!

How to Play:
Press "SPACE" to attack. If you attack too early (before the "!") appears, you will be blocked from making further attacks 
and essentially left open to getting hit and losing! Strike as soon as the "!" shows up before your opponent attacks you to win.

To Do:
- Add a reset game key "R"
- Add sound effects
